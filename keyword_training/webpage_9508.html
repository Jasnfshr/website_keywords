				<div class="toggle-content"><p>In consideration of being permitted to participate in this convention, event, or meeting organized by the Society for Promotion of Japanese Animation (“SPJA”) (each referred to as the “Event”), I hereby acknowledge and agree to the following terms and conditions of participation (this “Waiver”):</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>    I have read, understand, and agree to abide by the Code of Conduct and Weapons Policy for this Event, which are incorporated into this Waiver as though set forth herein. I understand and agree that this Waiver, together with any other policies or instructions posted on the web site or communicated by employees, officials, officers, volunteers, or other persons affiliated with or acting for or on behalf of the SPJA, the City, or any Official Hotel, are effective and apply to me at all times when I am present on and around the Venue and Official Hotels in connection with the Event. The “Venue” refers to the location at which the Event is held. “Official Hotels” are hotels that the SPJA has explicitly designated as such for the Event. The “City” refers to the city in which an Event is held.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>    I understand that my participation in any activity at the Event is voluntary. I FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT SOME ACTIVITIES AT THE EVENT, SUCH AS BUT NOT LIMITED TO DANCING OR ROLE PLAYING, HAVE INHERENT RISKS AND DANGERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OR INJURY TO MY PERSON OR PROPERTY, AND THAT AS A CONDITION OF BEING PERMITTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ANY ACTIVITY AT THE EVENT, I MUST ASSUME AND ACCEPT ALL RISKS OF HARM, LOSS, OR INJURY THAT MAY ARISE FROM OR BE RELATED TO PARTICIPATION IN THAT ACTIVITY. I HEREBY WAIVE AND RELEASE, indemnify, and hold harmless the SPJA, the City, the Venue, the Official Hotels, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, affiliates, contractors, volunteers, managers, sponsors, funders, attendees, public officials, successors and assigns (“Released Parties”), from any and all demands, damages, losses, liabilities, causes of action, lawsuits, attorneys’ fees, and/or claims of every kind and nature, whether known or unknown, in law or equity, that I ever had or may have, arising from or in any way related to my participation in the Event, including acts or omissions by third parties such as medical providers and vendors of food or drink, arising from or in any way connected with my participation in the Event. I understand the nature of the Event activities in which I participate and represent that I am qualified to participate in such activities. I further acknowledge that I am aware that the Event will be conducted in facilities open to the public. I agree and warrant that if at any time I believe conditions of an Event activity to be unsafe, I will immediately discontinue further participation in the activity. I intend and desire for this Waiver to be interpreted as broadly as permitted under California law. This Waiver does NOT apply to any acts of gross negligence or intentional, willful, or wanton misconduct on the part of any Released Party.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>    In the Event of any injury or illness to me during my participation, I authorize the staff of the Event, the SPJA, the Venue, or any Official Hotel to seek and obtain such emergency or medical services as may be deemed necessary at the time, but understand and agree that they shall not be obligated to do so.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>    I understand and acknowledge that if I break, deface, harm, or damage any real or personal property in connection with my participation in the Event, including but not limited to property of the Venue, any Official Hotel, or the City, I shall be solely and personally responsible for paying any and all costs and incidental or consequential damages relating to the replacement or repair of the damaged item or facility.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>    <strong>General Terms.</strong> No waiver or amendment of any provision of this Waiver will be effective unless in writing. This Waiver shall be construed using the laws of the State of California, except as they apply to conflicts of law. The language in all parts of this Waiver shall be construed as a whole in accordance with its fair meaning, not for or against any party, and without regard to any statutes that provide for the language of an agreement to be construed against the drafter. If any provision herein is determined to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed and all other provisions shall remain in effect. I consent to the jurisdiction of any federal or state court within Los Angeles, California. This Waiver shall bind and be for the benefit of myself, SPJA, and our respective heirs, fiduciaries, successors, and assigns. I have not relied upon any promise, representation, or warranty in signing this Waiver. This Waiver will continue in full force and effect even after the conclusion of the Event. You understand and agree that your electronic submission of agreement to this Waiver constitutes an electronic signature that is just as legally binding as your signature on a hard copy of the Waiver. Further, you agree that no certification authority or other third-party verification is required to validate this electronic signature, and that the lack of such certification or third-party verification shall not in any way effect the enforceability of this Waiver.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>I SUBMIT THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, OF MY OWN FREE WILL AND FREE OF PRESSURE, DURESS, OR THREAT OF DURESS. I HAVE READ THIS ENTIRE FORM CAREFULLY. I UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ACCEPTING THIS WAIVER, I HAVE GIVEN UP CONSIDERABLE FUTURE LEGAL RIGHTS. MY SIGNATURE IS PROOF OF MY INTENTION TO EXECUTE A COMPLETE AND UNCONDITIONAL WAIVER AND RELEASE SPJA OF ALL LIABILITY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. I AM OVER 18 YEARS OLD AND I AM MENTALLY COMPETENT.</strong></p>
<p><center><strong>Parent or Guardian’s Additional Release for Minors</strong></center>In consideration of the minor attendee (the “Minor”) being permitted by the SPJA to participate in the Event, I the undersigned represent and affirm that I am the parent or legal guardian of the Minor whose name appears above and that I have the authority to enter into this agreement on the Minor’s behalf. I understand and agree that the above terms and conditions apply to the Minor and to me. I further agree to indemnify and hold harmless the SPJA from any and all claims that are brought by, or on behalf of, the Minor, and which are in any way connected with the Minor’s participation in the Event. I represent and warrant that I am over 18 years old and I am mentally competent.</p>

							<span class="toggle-title">Code of Conduct</span>
				<div class="toggle-content"><p>Following this simple Code of Conduct helps everyone have fun and be safer at the convention. Your own good judgment and courtesy toward others are key. Watch out for each other, take care of one another, help those who need help, and be careful. Don’t leave the event with strangers, make sure that your friends know if you are going home early, and call security if you see anything suspicious. Minors should not go to hotel rooms with adults. Play it clean, sober, and safe.</p>
<p>To participate in our event (which we will refer to as the “Event” here, whether it’s Anime Expo, Anime Conji, Project Anime, or another one of our events), you must agree to comply with this Code of Conduct.</p>
<h3><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></h3>
<p>Please wear your Event badge at all times during the Event. Please be prepared to show proof of age and identification when entering the Event or any program at the Event. We will only accept the following forms of identification: government-issued driver’s licenses or identification cards, passports, or military identification.</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<p><strong>PROHIBITED ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p>The following are <b>not permitted </b>at the Event or its surrounding perimeters, including the parking lots and structures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failure to be appropriately clothed, the sole discretion of Society for Promotion of Japanese Animation (“SPJA). Please follow local laws, rules, and regulations when selecting your costume.</li>
<li>Assaulting, threatening, or behaving inappropriately to another person, in SPJA’s sole discretion.</li>
<li>Lewd or offensive behavior, such as profanity, obscene language or conduct, profanity, or racial, religious, or ethnic slurs.</li>
<li>Commercial or business transactions conducted without the SPJA’s prior written consent, whether in the form of an exhibitor agreement, sponsorship agreement, vendor agreement, facility rental agreement, or otherwise. This includes, without limitation, the solicitation of money or other contributions or donations, or distribution of commercial advertising or promotional material of any kind, or offering samples of items which are sold, available for sale, or available in exchange for a donation or contribution.</li>
<li>Unlawful conduct or failure to comply with the policies, rules, or instructions of the SPJA, the Event staff, the Event facility, or the hotel affiliated with the Event.</li>

</ul>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<p><strong>PROHIBITION AGAINST THE USE OF SIGNS</strong></p>
<p>All signs, whether for a costume prop or not, are prohibited unless approved in writing for specific use by Event Staff. Unapproved signs will be confiscated and repeat offenses may lead to individuals being asked to forfeit your attendee badge and may result in being banned from the convention.</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>
<p><strong>RECORDING POLICY</strong></p>
<p>You agree that you may be recorded during the Event without compensation and you hereby grant to the SPJA the rights to reproduce, display, distribute, perform, create derivative works from, and otherwise use any still photographs and moving sound and audiovisual recordings (“Recordings”) of you in any media and in any manner throughout the world in perpetuity, including on the internet, broadcast, satellite and other transmissions.</p>
<p>You are generally allowed to make Recordings in all common areas of the Event, with the exception of the Art Show, backstage, and restricted areas. Specific rules and restrictions regarding Recordings apply to specific events. If you are unsure, please check and follow the instructions given.</p>
<p>Please obtain permission first to make Recordings of any individuals or costumes. If someone asks or otherwise indicates that they do not wish to be recorded, do not record them. The SPJA will make reasonable efforts to enforce this policy, but given the proliferation of recording devices and the ease with which Event attendees may conceal their recording devices, it is understood and agreed that the SPJA shall not be liable for violations.</p>
<p>Recordings of the Event or its employees, staff, or attendees for the purpose of sale, and/or publication to the press is expressly forbidden unless written permission has been obtained from the SPJA, as well the policy of any venue in which you are recording. Individuals may make Recordings for private listening/viewing, provided that such Recordings clearly identify the Event, date, and location at which they were recorded.</p>
<p>All bloggers and members of the press and staff are additionally required to conform to the SPJA’s Press Policy and we encourage attendees to become familiar with those rules.</p>
<div class="spacer"></div>

<li>Violation of any federal, state, or local law regarding alcoholic beverages.</li>
<li>Violation of any policy of the Event facility or any Event vendor or concessionaire regarding alcoholic beverages.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>During the convention an Information Services kiosk booth will be located at the event for questions, concerns or inquires. Check your Event Map or program guide for location.</p>
<p><b>If you need immediate assistance</b>, please don’t hesitate to approach anyone on the Event staff or contact us online.</p>

							<span class="toggle-title">Weapons Policy</span>
				<div class="toggle-content"><h6><strong>Weapons Policy</strong></h6>
<p>Your participation in the Event means that you agree to comply with this Weapons Policy. The “Event” means any event held by the Society for Promotion of Japanese Animation (“SPJA” or “we”), such as Anime Expo®, Anime Conji®, and Project Anime®.</p>
<p>You further understand and agree that, for your own safety and the safety of everyone at the Event, SPJA has the absolute and immediate right to inspect your costumes, prop weapons, and any other item you bring to the Event. We may temporarily or permanently remove any attendee at any time for violating this Weapons Policy &#8212; because your safety, and every attendee’s safety, is so important.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>No real weapons are allowed at the Event.</strong></span></p>
<p>This includes firearms, knives, curio, relic, and antique firearms, and every form of ammunition, whether carried openly or concealed and even if the weapons are inoperable or unusable. Even items that may be legal for you to own or carry are not welcome at our events if they violate this Weapons policy. The following are examples of weapons that you CANNOT bring to the Event:</p>
<p><strong>FIREARMS, AMMUNITION, RIFLES, SHOTGUNS, HANDGUNS, BLOWGUNS, TAZERS, LASER POINTERS, LASER-AIMING DEVICES OR SIMILAR LASER DEVICES, EXPLOSIVES OR OTHER INCENDIARY DEVICES, KNIVES, LIVE BLADES/SWORDS (INCLUDING KATANA AND OTHER MARTIAL ARTS STYLE SWORDS), DAGGERS, SWORD CANES, SWITCHBLADES, BALI-SONG (BUTTERFLY) KNIVES, AXES, HATCHETS, METAL POLE-ARMS, CLUBS, WOODEN/METAL BATS AND PADDLES, HUNTING BOWS, ARROWS, NUNCHUCKS,BRASS KNUCKLES, WHIPS, PEPPERSPRAY/MACE, POWER TOOLS, STILTS, VUVUZELAS, OR ANY ITEM THAT IS ILLEGAL IN THE CALIFORNIA OR THAT APPEARS, IN SPJA MANAGEMENT’S DISCRETION, TO BE DANGEROUS OR WHICH WOULD PLACE OTHERS IN IMMEDIATE HARM AND OR EXCEED A DECIBEL LEVEL OF 85.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prop Weapons are allowed only if they are Peace Bonded by Weapons Check.</strong></span></p>
<p>Prop weapons are inoperable weapons that support the overall look of your costume or character. For example, Airsoft guns, Nerf guns, water guns, dart guns, disc guns, pellet guns, and cap guns are prop weapons.</p>
<p>Prop weapons must be submitted to “Weapons Check” for Peace Bonding. SPJA has the sole discretion to approve prop weapons. Anime Expo’s Weapons Check booths are located in both the South Hall Lobby and the West Hall Lobby. Other Event Weapons Check booths shall be designated in the programs and on signs.</p>
<p>We may revoke Peace Bonding at any time in our sole discretion. For example, we will revoke approval if you use or brandish the item in an inappropriate fashion (like play-fighting or swinging the weapon around). We will also revoke approval if we receive complaints about the way you are using or displaying your prop weapon or futuristic device, or if you tamper with the device that Weapons Check uses to show that your prop weapon has been Peace Bonded.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Peace Bonding Rules</strong></span></p>
<p>If a prop weapon is, or was, at any time capable of firing anything, it must be rendered permanently inoperable in order to qualify for Peace Bonding. You can do this by, for example, permanently plugging the barrel with glue, caulk, or any non-removable substance. You must be able to prove that the gun is permanently decommissioned upon inspection. Bring tools if necessary</p>
<p>In addition, to be Peace Bonded, your weapon must meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your prop weapon can’t be more than 7 feet (2.13 meters) long or weigh more than 15 pounds (6.8 kilograms).</li>
<li>Prop explosives cannot be made out of metal.</li>
<li>All swords or bladed martial arts weapons must be blunt-edged and cannot have any sort of cutting or sharpened edge (no live steel). Metal swords must have a sheath and must remain in the sheath for the duration of the Event. Whenever possible, for the purposes of keeping metal swords in sheaths, we recommend anchoring the sword to the sheath. We also reserve the right to anchor bladed weapons shut.</li>
<li>All prop bows must be unstrung or have a low-tensile thread.</li>
<li>All prop arrows must have non-metal, blunted tips.</li>
<li>Metal chains must be less than 12 inches long and no more than one inch thick.</li>
<li>Non-metal chains must be under a reasonable length so as not to pose a safety or fire hazard.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your prop weapon looks realistic, then federal law requires that it either be translucent enough to see inside, or be at least half covered with solid white or bright red, orange, yellow, green, blue, pink, or purple. 15 CFR § 1150.3.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Peace-bonded weapons at the Event.</strong></span></p>
<p>You may display your prop weapons only as costume pieces. Do not swing or brandish your prop weapon in any way that could be considered unsafe or threatening.</p>
<p>You may pose with a prop weapon in a brandishing manner, so long as no reasonable person would interpret it as anything but a pose for dramatic effect. Event staff or management may stop your posed brandishing in their sole discretion.</p>
<p>Please put your prop weapons away when leaving the Event site at night so that you don’t get the attention of local law enforcement. SPJA cannot be responsible for any actions taken by local law 2 enforcement – such as detention and questioning – if you decide to display or brandish your prop weapons at or outside of the Event.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Martial Arts Performances &amp; Demos</strong></span></p>
<p>You may display working martial arts weapons during, and 30 minutes before and after, a performance that has been approved by Event management in advance.</p>
<p>Of course, you must use common sense to avoid harming any person or property. You must conceal or wrap the weapons when transporting them to and from the demonstration, and you must remove the weapons immediately after the demonstration. Con staff reserves the right to stop any performance or demonstration in their sole discretion.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Uniformed Costumes</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>COSTUMES THAT MAY BE CONFUSED WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OR OTHER EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL UNIFORMS ARE NOT PERMITTED AT THE EVENT.</strong></p>
<p>It’s just not safe to impersonate local law enforcement or other emergency personnel. SPJA has the absolute right and sole discretion to decide whether your costume looks too much like one of these uniforms, and to request the removal or modification of that costume. If you don’t cooperate, we may expel you from the Event in order to protect the safety and welfare of everyone there.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If You Buy Weapons at the Event</strong></span></p>
<p>If you buy a prop or other weapon from at the Event, you must immediately submit it to Weapons Check or remove it from the Event hall.</p>

							<span class="toggle-title">Autographs FAQ</span>
				<div class="toggle-content"><p>What<strong> is needed to get an autograph from a Guest of Honor(GoH)?</strong><br />
All GoH signing sessions require a ticket that will be dispersed at the Autograph Ticket Booth in West Hall.</p>
<p><strong>How do I get a ticket for a Guest of Honor autograph session?</strong><br />
A pre-set number of tickets for each Guest of Honor (GoH) signing session will be made available at no additional cost at the Autograph Ticket Booth on the same day as the scheduled session.</p>
<p><strong>When will tickets be distributed?</strong><br />
Tickets will start being distributed at 8am each day, only for the autograph sessions scheduled on the same day.The schedule for each GoH distribution will be available onsite at the Autograph Ticket Booth and online.</p>
<p><strong>How many tickets will be distributed?</strong><br />
We are limited to 75 guaranteed* autograph tickets per session. After the guaranteed tickets are distributed, 50 Standby Tickets will be issued.</p>
<p><strong>What are standby tickets?</strong><br />
Standby tickets grant you access to the waitlist for autographs and are subject to GoH’s availability.<br />
Standby tickets ARE NOT a guarantee that you will receive an autograph.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I get a standby ticket?</strong><br />
Standby Tickets are only issued at the Autograph Ticket Booth and will be issued in sequential order. The number printed on each ticket indicates your position in the standby line.</p>
<p><strong>How many tickets can I get?</strong><br />
Tickets are limited to one per person and are distributed on a first come, first served basis.</p>
<p><strong>How many autographs can I get per session?</strong><br />
One autograph ticket will grant each attendee only one autograph. Only one autograph ticket may be redeemed per person.</p>
<p><strong>What information will be on the ticket?</strong><br />
Each ticket will list the GoH name, time, date, and location of the session.</p>
<p><strong>If I miss the autograph session, can I use the ticket for another session?</strong><br />
No, Tickets are valid only for the session printed on the ticket.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to have a ticket get an autograph?</strong><br />
All autograph sessions will require a respective ticket; no substitutions will be made.</p>
<p><strong>How do I redeem my ticket?</strong><br />
All Autograph tickets will state the date, time and location of the session.</p>
<p><strong>When can I start lining up for the autograph session?</strong><br />
Lines will start 30 minutes prior to each session.</p>
<p><strong>What can be signed?</strong><br />
Attendees are responsible for providing their own items to be signed. All items are subject to Guest’s approval*. All items must be properly licensed.</p>
<p>Rules and restrictions on what will or will not be signed are subject to change so please be sure to have your item checked by Autograph Staff prior to any session. Attendees are recommended to bring at least one backup item in case their item of choice cannot be signed.</p>
<p><small>*It is also recommended that all items are from a project the GoH has worked on.</small></p>
<p><strong>Other notes:</strong></p>
<p>Autograph sessions are subject to change or cancellation at any time without notice. Autograph tickets of any kind only denote eligibility to receive an autograph at a Guest of Honor’s scheduled signing session.</p>
<p>If you have questions about the autograph session or policy, please ask an Autograph Staff member at the Autograph Ticket Booth.</p>
<p>Premiere Fans: Premiere Fans do not get special privileges for Autograph Ticketing or Autograph Sessions.</p>
<p><small>*As long as there are no extraordinary circumstances such as natural or man-made disaster, illness, or giant robot attacks that prevent the GoH from holding an autograph session.</small></p>
<h4>UPDATE 7/3/15</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are Autograph Sessions and Industry Guest Autographs the same? </strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>They are not the same. Autograph Sessions are located in Kentia Hall, while Industry Guest Autograph may be located in their sponsored booths in the Exhibit Hall. Some Industry Guests may hold autograph sessions in Kentia Hall. If so, they will be listed on the autograph schedule <a href="http://www.anime-expo.org/schedule/?tab=autographs">here</a>.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Is ticketing for each autograph session in the same location as the sessions themselves?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>No, </strong>the Autograph Ticketing Booths are located in <strong>Concourse Hall near the West Hall entrance</strong> while the Autograph sessions themselves take place in <strong>Kentia Hall (in South Hall).</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Where can I wait to get into the Autographs Ticketing Booth before 8AM (the time when the ticketing session starts)?</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can wait right outside Concourse Hall forming lines immediately outside the entrance against the convention center wall. <strong>Please do not hesitate to ask any nearby Access Control Staff Volunteers (someone wearing a red vest) on how the ticketing line should be properly organized. <em>Your place for ticketing starts outside Concourse Hall!</em></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How can I get to the Autographs Ticketing Booths once I’m in LACC?</strong>
<ul>
<li>All <strong>autographs ticketing</strong> (both priority and standby) will take place in booths at <strong>Concourse Hall near the West Hall entrance. </strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>When does ticketing start and end?</strong>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Ticketing <strong>starts at 8AM and promptly ends at 12PM</strong>. Please be on time!</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>What’s the difference between Guarantee/Priority and Standby tickets? </strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>75 Guaranteed tickets are issued first, following 50 standby tickets for each autographs session. Both guaranteed and standby tickets are first come, first served. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Guarantee/Priority Tickets (Pink colored)</strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Guarantee/Priority ticket holders are <strong>guaranteed</strong> an autograph from the guest labeled on the ticket <em>at the specified time also printed on the ticket.</em></li>
<li><em>There are 75 guaranteed tickets.</em></li>
<li>Therefore the number issued on guaranteed tickets does not correlate with a guaranteed ticket holder’s place in line. <strong>Everyone with a guaranteed ticket will be able to receive a signature from the guest labeled on their ticket no matter where they are placed in the guaranteed line. </strong></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standby (Blue colored)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Standby ticket holders <strong>are not guaranteed</strong> autographs but <strong>will have a chance to receive autographs at the discretion of the Guest of Honor(s) they are waiting for. </strong></li>
<li><em>There are 50 standby tickets.</em></li>
<li><strong><em>Standby ticketholders must line up numerically in their designated area behind the guaranteed ticketholders of the same session. </em></strong><strong>Numbers are listed on each ticket.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li><strong>Do Premiere fans receive special privileges for Autograph Ticketing or Sessions?</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>No, </strong>premiere fans must line up for ticketing and for sessions with regular ticketholders. <strong>No exceptions will be made.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>What’s the procedure for guests represented by the ADA and their helper(s)? What’s the procedure if a ADA guest does not have a helper? </strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>ADA attendees and one helper each need a ticket for each autograph session they attend, whether they get a guarantee or standby one. </strong>If the A<strong>DA attendee for any reason cannot wait in line to get a ticket, we will have a volunteer on standby to act as a proxy</strong> to wait in line for them with the ADA attendee&#8217;s helper.</li>
<li>ADA attendees don&#8217;t <strong>need </strong>to have an helper with them. <strong>If they have two or more helpers,</strong> <strong>they are limited to have one go to the front with them for Guaranteed tickets.</strong> For standby tickets, it will be the same procedure for waiting in line.</li>
<li>Once a session begins, guaranteed ticketholders have to be in line when the session starts. For standby ticketholders, they can come during the session and line up in numerical order in a designated area away from the guaranteed ticket line.</li>
<li><strong>Guarantee tickets are allowed front of line access due to time constraints of each session.</strong> ADA attendees with guaranteed tickets should show up about 15 minutes before the session as they cannot show up during due to their front of the line access that can better organized if they arrive at one designated time rather than periodically.</li>
<li><strong>Standby tickets are not guaranteed front of line access as the ticket lines are organized numerically for fairness but this can be changed due to autograph session traffic. </strong>ADA attendees with standby tickets should arrive when the desired autographs session is halfway done as that will be the time when the organization of the standby line is well underway. However a proxy will be provided for a ADA attendee with a standby ticket should he/she would like one for any reason.</li>
<li><strong>Please contact an Autograph staff volunteer to for ADA assistance!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How I do I get to the Autographs sessions since it’s not in the same place as ticketing?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Autograph Sessions</strong> take place in <strong>Kentia Hall</strong> in the area under the banner labeled “Autographs”. After entering the hall, please make an immediate right and follow signs to the designated Autographs area entrance to be ushered in into the area by an Autographs Staff Volunteer.</p>
